    "\n",
    "A **graph** is a data structure used to represent relationships between objects. A graph consists of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nodes (Vertices):** The entities being connected.\n",
    "- **Edges:** The connections or relationships between nodes.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Types of Graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Undirected Graphs:** Edges are bidirectional (e.g., Facebook friendships).\n",
    "- **Weighted Graphs:** Edges have values, such as distance or cost (e.g., road networks).\n",
    "- **Directed Graphs:** Edges have direction (e.g., Twitter followers).\n",
    "![Directed Graph](/tri3frontend/images/directed.png){: style=\"width: 30%;\"}\n",
    "- **Unweighted Graphs:** All edges are considered equal.\n",

    "### **Graph Representation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs can be stored in different ways depending on the problem and efficiency needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Adjacency Matrix:** Uses a 2D table where rows and columns represent nodes, and cell values indicate if an edge exists (1 for connected, 0 for no connection).\n",
    "- **Adjacency List:** Each node stores a list of its neighboring nodes, making it more space-efficient for sparse graphs.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **heuristic** is a problem-solving approach that **simplifies** the solution process by using rules of thumb.\n",

    "### **Real-World Example**\n",
    "\n",

    "- **Heuristic Approach:** Go directly to the **Science section** if you're looking for a science book.\n",

    "### **Examples of Heuristic Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Greedy Algorithms:** Always choose the **best immediate** option.\n",
    "- **A* Search:** Finds the quickest path from one point to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Real-World Application of Heuristics**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Navigation:** In Google Maps, an approximation of the shortest route is calculated using heuristics (Dijkstra's algorithm).\n",
