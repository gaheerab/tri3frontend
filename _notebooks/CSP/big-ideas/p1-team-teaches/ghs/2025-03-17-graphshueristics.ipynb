    "A **graph** is a data structure used to represent relationships between objects. A graph consists of:\n",
    "- **Nodes (Vertices):** The entities being connected.  \n",
    "- **Edges:** The connections or relationships between nodes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: white;\">Real-World Example</h3>  \n",
    "- **Social Networks**: In Facebook, **friends** are the **nodes**, and the **edges** represent **friendships** between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: white;\">Types of Graphs</h3>  \n",
    "- **Directed Graphs:** Edges have direction (e.g., Twitter followers).  \n",
    "- **Undirected Graphs:** Edges are bidirectional (e.g., Facebook friendships).  \n",
    "- **Weighted Graphs:** Edges have values, such as distance or cost (e.g., road networks).  \n",
    "- **Unweighted Graphs:** All edges are considered equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: white;\">Applications of Graphs</h3>  \n",
    "- **Social Networks**: Connecting users and their relationships.  \n",
    "- **Navigation Systems**: Finding the shortest route in Google Maps (unweighted and weighted graphs).  \n",
    "- **Recommendation Systems**: Netflix suggesting movies based on connections between viewers and genres.\n",

    "<h3 style=\"color: white;\">1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)</h3>  \n",
    "- **How it works**: Explores all **neighboring** nodes first, then moves on to their neighbors, and so on.  \n",
    "- **Real-life Example**: Think of spreading a message through a network. You tell all your **immediate friends**, then they tell their friends, and so on.  \n",
    "- **Use Case**: Finding the **shortest path** in an **unweighted graph**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: white;\">2. Depth-First Search (DFS)</h3>  \n",
    "- **How it works**: Explores as **deeply** as possible along one path, backtracking when no further nodes can be explored.  \n",
    "- **Real-life Example**: Exploring a mazeâ€”following one path all the way to the end before trying another one.  \n",
    "- **Use Case**: Solving puzzles like **Sudoku** or searching for connected components in a graph.  \n",

    "<h2 style=\"color: white;\">3. Heuristics (Basic Introduction)</h2>  \n",
    "A **heuristic** is a problem-solving approach that **simplifies** the solution process by using rules of thumb, aiming for a \"good enough\" solution, not necessarily the optimal one. This concept is often applied in more complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: white;\">Real-World Example</h3>  \n",
    "Imagine looking for a book in a library:  \n",
    "- **Brute Force Approach**: Check every shelf one by one.  \n",
    "- **Heuristic Approach**: Go directly to the **Science section** if you're looking for a science book.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: white;\">Examples of Heuristic Algorithms</h3>  \n",
    "- **Greedy Algorithms**: Always choose the **best immediate** option, like picking the cheapest item first.  \n",
    "- **A* Search**: Finds an efficient path by considering both the current state and a predicted future state (commonly used in pathfinding).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color: white;\">Real-World Application of Heuristics</h3>  \n",
    "- **Navigation**: In Google Maps, an approximation of the shortest route is calculated using heuristics.\n",
